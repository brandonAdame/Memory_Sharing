This repo contains my class assignment for finding the best backwards
increasing sublist. A book of mountains was passed as input through the 
command line. The book consisted of mountain names and elevations.

Example Input:

Eiger            3970
Everest          8848
Denali           5500
Fuji             3776
GangkharPuensum  7570
K2               8611
Kilamanjaro      5895
Matterhorn       4478
Olympus          2917
Tocopuri         5808
Tupungato        6570
Whitney          4421

Output:

Fuji             3776
Matterhorn       4478
Tocopuri         5808
Tupungato        6570

# Objective
Find the best backwards increasing sublist. Implemented using linked list
data structure and chaining to combat collisions.
